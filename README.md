### Sample-demonstration-of-the-use-of-Polars-python-library-for-datascience


How can polars outperform pandas?

Unlike pandas, polars is lazy and semi-lazy. In lazy Polars, we can do query optimization on an entire query in order to improve performance and memory pressure. That said, you could do all your work eagerly with polars as youâ€™d do with pandas.



#### First Things First: Install The Library


To install Polars, we have to run the command below.

# pip
pip install polars

# conda
conda install polars
